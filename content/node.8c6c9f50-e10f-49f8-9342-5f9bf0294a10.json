We know that Avram Brankovich, Yusuf Masudi, and Samuel Cohen are just fictional characters from the 17th century. Milorad Pavich made a cool model how what it can look like when one story is described by a few people. They tell stories from their different points of view and from the plot and the result of the novel in those 3 cases is pretty different. They work on the same story but they don't know about each other and they don't communicate, cooperate, and so on.<\/p><img data-entity-uuid=\"b313b6e8-7ae4-4495-bee1-cca479fb4a61\" data-entity-type=\"file\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-images\/emmanuel-phaeton-LFdLnnzvJw4-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Book opened: Photo by Emmanuel Phaeton on Unsplash.\"><p>While the model where people work independently on the different parts of the novel may work as well, the Open-Source Literature approach recommends people communicate and cooperate with the other members of the crew and propose improvements in the texts of the other people.
